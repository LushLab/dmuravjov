    <h2>App design system and rebrand</h2>
    <p>
        With the Zoopla rebrand and design system rolled out, I took ownership of rebranding and creating a design system for the Zoopla App from the core Design system. Using the core design system as a base to build the App library, enabled me to reuse similar components and create variants as needed to support the App application without creating duplicate components.

    <h2>Auditing and defining the design system</h2>
    <p>
        To ensure that the whole App journey is captured I audited the whole App and redesigned each journey using the new design system to populate and create new App-specific components. With the App experiences redesigned using the new brand, breaking down the experiences into various component types based on the core design system allowed a preview into the App library to ensure that it was consistent and necessary.

    <h2>Assembling the components</h2>
    <p>
        With the product rebranded and the components categorised, I started by rebuilding the components using the foundations and elements from the core design system. Building out the library using the core design system provided a synced single source of truth that ensures consistency and removes duplications.

    <h2>Testing, refinement and support</h2>
    <p>
        To ensure the App design system was stable and flexible, recreating the app experience using the design system prevented missing any errors. To ensure the product was ready for release I facilitated multiple 1-to-1 testing sessions to onboard the new App designer into the system as well as reviewing the variant and behaviours for any flaws.

    <h2>Rebranding the app store screens</h2>
    <p>
        With the App design system rolled out across the app designs & with engineering re-platforming the product in the background. With the app rollout imminent I took lead in putting together the new app store visuals across multiple sizes to ensure that the app store artwork was ready to update with the new app rollout.
