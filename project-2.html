        Worked as a core contributor in a team of 4 to craft a new Design system for Web, App and Software products. Following the Atomic approach and with the use of Tokens we created a centralized design system that is used as the core, giving us the ability to create more product-specific design systems, as well as overwrite the brand through theming. Tokens have been a core contributor to finding a common between engineering and design and ensuring that we are creating and coding consistently.

    <h2>Leading up to the project</h2>
    <p>
        Before the rebrand in 2020 the Zoopla products were ridden with multiple code stacks resulting in products and experiences being inconsistent and making releases requiring large efforts from multiple teams to ensure no breaking changes. The rebrand taking place provided us with an opportunity to create a fresh new design system that will bring consistency and alignment across products.

    <h2>The begining </h2>
    <p>
        To ensure that we build a comprehensive design system that will enable all of our current and future experiences, I took ownership to Audit the current website and all of its experiences and states. To create a sense of the scale for the initial design system laying out the screenshots of all current experiences allowed me to sort and categorise the current designs into an Atomic structure generating an initial view of the scale of the design system. With the audit ready and the current landscape mapped out the Rebrand project took place to pave the way for the brand its use and its future application across the design system and its interactions.

    <h2>Redesigning current components and patterns</h2>
    <p>
        With the brand rolled out a small central design system team was established to create a new globally centralised design system for the website that was used to empower the app design system and software design system. Using the Audit created prior to the rebrand as a starting point to capture and redesign components using the new brand language enabled us to start looking and defining rules for the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        With foundations, elements and patterns redesigned we started first setting up the foundations to enable the elements and patterns to use shared styling as the Figma CSS layer. Next, we could start crafting the elements such as buttons, lists etc.. which are used as the core building blocks to build out the patterns that contain various variants and props to provide the required functionality for various uses.

    <h2>Testing components</h2>
    <p>
        Before rolling out the design system, we tested out the design system in isolation and by rebuilding the core website experiences. Using the new design system to rebuild the majority of the website allowed us to identify and remove any bugs or unwanted behaviours that were discovered in the process, before releasing and onboarding designers.

    <h2>Documenting and creating guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        With a new design system in place, to ensure that product teams are able to use the design system and apply the new brand language correctly and consistently, Using Frontify as our source of truth for the brand and design system documentation, I took lead in documenting the design system and creating easy to absorb guidelines and short videos showing how to use the components. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We compared the onboarding process before and after the design system which saw designers being able to onboard and start contributing within 1 week, which helped the product teams to onboard designers 4 times quicker than previously.
    </p>

    <h2>Defining the process for maintaining & scaling</h2>
    <p>
        To maintain and grow a successful design system we needed to establish a process around using and contributing to the design system to enable product teams to grow and scale the system. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Presenting in workshops to the designers and engineers allowed us to test and refine our process to be clear and concise to ensure clear consistent communication. Trello provided us with a simple ticket system containing pre-created templates for various request types.
