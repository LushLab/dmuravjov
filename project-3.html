        To ensure that the rebrand and its application across the core experiences were consistent and scalable, my primary goal was to establish the Northstar designs for the core landing pages and the My home hub experiences. The Northstar designs allowed for further collaboration between myself, content designers and product designers to refine and define and prioritise components/sections based on their value to the business and the user journeys. Based on the prioritisation we established the enabling MVP designs that were consistent and enabled teams to plan future iteration tickets.

    <h2>Start of the project</h2>
    <p>
        To gain a broad and in-depth perspective into the current brand application and its use across the website and app, I began by composing an audit compiling screenshots of the current pages and their journeys. By zooming out we were able to distinguish where similarities and inconsistencies were apparent, which flagged up an issue that required more in-depth rules and guides to be created to help designers make consistent and on-brand choices.

    <h2>Planning the new page IA</h2>
    <p>
       To ensure that the information architecture is aligned with the key user tasks, key value propositions and provides clear and intuitive and relevant onward journeys. We began by researching and analysing our competitors and using data from google analytics and content square to outline the key areas for improvement and iteration.

    <h2>Building out MVP designs</h2>
    <p>
        With the IA agreement, I began aligning the landing pages to the most recent New Homes experience, to create a consistent approach across our key landing pages. With the first iterations for the MVP landing pages designed, an outsourced agency came on board to build out the MVP pages using the design system. With the agency building, and the MVP designs we started looking at the Northstar vision for our landing pages and its brand application.

    <h2>Concept development</h2>
    <p>
        With the brand still in the early stages and the future vision and direction not being set, I took lead in developing a concept that would enable designers to scale their products and apply the brand without oversight. Designing across all the key landing pages allowed me to systematise and find a common language between the experiences whilst providing flexibility to designers to experiment and push the design language further. Running a number of workshops between the designers enabled the concepts to take shape and reach a conclusion between the teams.

    <h2>Testing content and layout</h2>
    <p>
        With the layout and initial content designed, testing the concept with a range of users helped us provide insight into the content, IA and the order of components on the page to ensure that the users were presented with the most useful content first, and to ensure that we are moving in the right direction.

    <h2>Setting Landing page Northstar</h2>
    <p>
        With the initial user testing completed and analysed, the results led us to further improve and simplify various aspects of the experience including the content itself. To ensure transparency and inclusion we presented the user testing report and the newly evolved concepts to the teams to collect any last feedback and suggestions before moving into establishing the Northstar vision for the products, content and brand application.

    <h2>Current brand application issues</h2>
    <p>
        With the Northstar direction set for the landing pages, I started looking at the following journeys for the logged-in experience across products. Conducting a quick audit across the existing journeys provided a view of the brand application across the experiences, highlighting concerns of the brand not being applied correctly. After experimenting and critiquing colour application between brand and product teams, a set of guidelines were created to give designers more room to experiment.

    <h2>Finalising the Northstar</h2>
    <p>
        With guidelines composed I was able to focus on finalising the Northstar designs that paved the way for designers to learn how to translate and apply the brand in a consistent way across the products. To ensure each product team was clear and unblocked with the rollout, engaging in weekly product team catchups allowed me to align and create bespoke phased experiences that were in scope and in line with the business and the user needs. With the collaboration between the various teams, we arrived at generating a 3 step phase approach on how each team can rollout and plan the backlog for future iterations.
