        The Zoopla rebrand was accomplished through thorough organisation, timely planning and breadth of experimentation across multiple products and media types. Ensuring that the Zoopla brand is scalable and ready to face the future looking to ensure that the brand application across the variable media types is consistent was the key to success. By collaborating with a group of specialists from across the business as well as an outsourced agency, the tight nit team was able to analyse, plan and orchestrate the application and the rollout of the brand fluently across the platforms.

    <h2>Leading up to the rebrand</h2>
    <p>
        Before the rebrand project kicked off, the Zoopla brand had a vast mixture of styles applied across its journeys, with low-value pages being left alone the brand became diluted and brimming with inconsistencies and interdependencies. With a pile of aged code and repositories making changes was a process that required a team and a long period of time to release.

    <h2>Identifying today’s brand</h2>
    <p>
        Before understanding the brand as a whole and the areas that it is applied, we curated a global audit of all of our live experiences across our products and presented it to the wider rebrand team including the branding agency. Auditing the products allowed the whole team to get a full scope of the birdseye view across all of our product landscapes that need to be considered and taken into account for the rebrand.

    <h2>Exploring potential brand routes</h2>
    <p>
        With the rebrand kicked off, the rebrand team split up and began researching and gathering ideas to build a mood board of relevant brand ideas and uses. Through the research phase, we identifies 3 potential brand routes that needed testing and development before deciding on and refining a particular path forward.

    <h2>Route refinement</h2>
    <p>
        To get a sense of each route and how the brand could manifest itself we split out into smaller teams to ensure that each route was explored across the various products and platforms. Through multiple team critique workshops, we refined and narrowed the focus down to a single preferred route that stood out and connected with the business and the users.

    <h2>Executing the brand application and language</h2>
    <p>
        With the route defined, further route exploration development was required to ensure that the brand application across; the tone of voice, imagery and products was consistent, recognisable and provided room for the design and brand team to scale and develop. Testing across email, social, app, web, software, print and other mediums provided with a view of the brand across all media types.

    <h2>Testing before launch</h2>
    <p>
        To ensure the brand is heading in the right direction, user testing was neccessary to beguin mesassuring the impact of the rebrand. To ensure an even coverage of the brand materials presented, users were given a snippet of various product types and data to ensure that the brand works for consumer and customer side of the business.

    <h2>Documenting and knowledge transfer</h2>
    <p>
        With the brand language defined and developed, the next step was to enable designers and product teams to onboard and learn how to use the new brand. To ensure that the brand documentation is accessible by the business we created and rolled out the brand documentation into the Frontify platform which enabled us to embed live designs and live component examples, as well as store-branded assets such as imagery, and illustrations, fonts etc…
