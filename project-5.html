    <h2>The brief</h2>
    <p>
        I joined LYTT to build a design system for an existing SASS dashboard product that would enable the product team to design, test and develop the product using user insights. The new design system would be the solution that will allow the team to spend their time with the users instead of designing interfaces.

    <h2>Defining the library structure</h2>
    <p>
        The first thing to do was to do a thorough audit of the live SASS product capturing all the component variants, states and behaviours. With the components captured and isolated, we extracted the individual components building the product. The next main step in the process was to define a library structure and break down the segmented audited components to follow an atomic structure.

    <h2>Building out the system</h2>
    <p>
        With the design system structure defined the first step was to build out the foundations which act as the core of the library. With the foundations built, I could start building out the Assets, Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms which form the library structure.

    <h2>Documenting the LYTT Design system v.1</h2>
    <p>
        The next step was to document the design system in zero-height with the goal to create a single source of truth to ensure easy maintenance and a degree of automation. To ensure that the component embeds were auto maintained I created a dedicated space in Figma for storing documentation visuals and added them as frames into zero-height which is linked by showing the live source of truth from Figma.
